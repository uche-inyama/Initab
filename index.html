            <p>Getting started with Initab is easy. Open the SETTINGS panel and configure your preferences. CUSTOM LINKS are a popular (optional) feature that you might consider activating. Simply add some valid URLs to the CUSTOM LINKS section in the SETTINGS panel. The DATE & TIME section then gets replaced with your custom links. Don’t forget to try the optional TAB LIMITING feature. It automatically keeps your browser tabs limited to the number you choose by closing older tabs. Some like it, some don’t…so be careful.</p>
